## Catch Pokemon

---

Using the PokeAPI, create a React application that will allow you to either search for a pokemon by name (case-insensitive) or look up a random pokemon.

Each time a response renders, you should be able to "add" that pokemon to a team, up to a maximum of 6. You page should render all Pokemon in your team and their names and some associated data.

Finally, you should be able to delete these Pokemon from your team Array if you so desire.

The output of your fetch request should be rendered in its own component, and the Team should be rendered in a <Team/> component.
